#WSQRotaryView

WSQRotaryView is an [open-source][LICENSE] rotating [radial menu][radial-menu] implementation, created by [Why Status Quo, Inc][wsq-link]. It supports custom colors, fonts, icons and sizes.

Design Goals:
    
  - Easy to set-up  
    - The latest build of the libary is packaged as a .framework folder in the root of the repository
    - Drag and drop the framework into your Xcode project
    - Add the `objc` and `all_load` in the 'Other Linker Flags' section of Xcode's build settings.  
  <br>
  - Simple to use
    - Drag the wheel to your selected segment, release, and tap the middle button, or
    - Tap the segment you want, then tap the middle button to activate.

Limitations:

  - Can only support ~6 items in the wheel at a time, as you will run out of space
  - Uses CoreGraphics for drawing, which may lead to sub-optimal rendering on older devices
  - Inertia is not currently supported, the wheel simply  'snaps' to the nearest segment when the touch is released
  - Requires iOS 5.0 & later (for ARC, the new objective-c literals syntax, and weak references)
